# Gemini CLI Interaction Log

## Wednesday, August 13, 2025

### Initial Context Setup
- **Time:** [Current Time - I don't have access to the exact current time, so I'll leave this as a placeholder for now.]
- **Details:** The Gemini CLI session was initiated. The current working directory was identified as `/home/codes/Projects/BudgetWise`, and the folder structure was provided. Operating system was identified as Linux.

### Refactor Categories to use DB
- **Time:** [Current Time - Placeholder]
- **Details:**
    - Identified hardcoded categories in `src/app/budgets/page.tsx` and `src/components/dashboard/add-transaction.tsx`.
    - Confirmed `src/app/db-actions.ts` already contains a `getCategories` function to fetch categories from the database.
    - Confirmed `src/context/auth-context.tsx` is already set up to fetch categories using `getCategories` and provide them via the `useAuth` hook.
    - Removed the hardcoded `categories` array from `src/app/budgets/page.tsx`.
    - Modified `src/app/budgets/page.tsx` to use the `categories` array provided by the `useAuth` hook, including a check for an empty array.

### Fix Login Loading Issue
- **Time:** [Current Time - Placeholder]
- **Details:**
    - Identified that `verifySession` in `src/lib/auth.ts` is a server-side function, causing issues when called directly from client-side `AuthContext` after a client-side redirect.
    - Modified `signIn` function in `src/app/actions.ts` to return the `UserPayload` on successful login instead of performing a server-side redirect.
    - Modified `handleSubmit` in `src/app/login/page.tsx` to receive the `UserPayload`, update the `AuthContext` using `setUser`, and then perform a client-side `router.push('/')`.
    - Updated the return types of `signIn` and `signUp` in `src/app/actions.ts` to reflect the `UserPayload` return.
    - Imported `UserPayload` type in `src/app/actions.ts`.

### Fix userId Serialization Issue
- **Time:** [Current Time - Placeholder]
- **Details:**
    - Identified an error: "Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components from Server Components" due to `userId` being a MongoDB `ObjectId`.
    - Modified `signIn` function in `src/app/actions.ts` to convert `user._id` to a string (`user._id.toString()`) before creating the `UserPayload`.
    - Modified `updateUser` function in `src/app/actions.ts` to convert `updatedUser._id` to a string (`updatedUser._id.toString()`) before creating the `newSession`.

### Optimize User Data Fetching
- **Time:** [Current Time - Placeholder]
- **Details:**
    - Modified `User` interface in `src/context/auth-context.tsx` to only include `userId` and `email`.
    - Modified `signIn` function in `src/app/actions.ts` to return only `userId` and `email`.
    - Added `getUserDetails` server action in `src/app/actions.ts` to fetch full user details by `userId`.
    - Modified `src/app/myprofile/page.tsx` to fetch full user details using `getUserDetails` when the component mounts and `user.userId` is available, and to manage its own loading state.

### Fix Auto-Redirection After Signup
- **Time:** [Current Time - Placeholder]
- **Details:**
    - Identified that `src/app/signup/page.tsx` was not performing a client-side redirect after successful signup.
    - Modified `src/app/signup/page.tsx` to call `setUser(result.user)` and `router.push('/')` after a successful `signUp` call, similar to the login page.
